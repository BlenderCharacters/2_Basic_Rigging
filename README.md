## Section 2 - Basic Rigging - Lecture List
Here are the lectures of the course for this section...

### 1 Introduction to Section 2
+ Michael gives an overview, showing you what is coming up in the section ahead.
+ Start with some foundational controls
+ Setup our workspace to suit our task
+ Create a simple rig

### 2 The Outliner Getting Your Naming Right
+ You will understand the importance of naming throughout your project
+ A core skill to get right early on

### 2a Deletion Options
+ How to use the various deletion options
+ Creation but destruction

### 3 Basic Selection
+ Border Selection (B)
+ Circle Selection (C)

### 4 Speeding Up Your Selecting
+ Limit selection to visible
+ Wireframe viewport shading
+ Selecting more/less

### 5 What Is Topology
+ Not all things are created equal
+ Sometimes it doesn't matter
+ Sometimes it is critical to modelling
+ (Updated 22/10/2017)

### 6 Advanced Selection Methods
+ Edge loops
+ Face loops
+ (Updated 19/10/2017)

### 7 Proportional Editing
+ Really Useful when modelling
+ Confusing if left on or influence too large
+ (Updated 20/10/2017)

### 8 Materials And Shading
+ Flat and smooth shading
+ Different shading objects in object and edit mode
+ What is a material
+ Materials are render engine specific
+ Often they will have to be re setup
+ Simple material creation
+ Material slots and reusing materials
+ (Updated 22/10/2017)

### 9 Origins, 3d Cursor And Pivot Points
+ The location of the origin point is important when translating, rotating or scaling an object
+ Take control of how object transform
+ Understand the properties of an object are the object origin's properties
+ The origin affects physics calculations

### 10 Transforms and Applying Them
+ Quick Tip
+ Edit in Edit Mode
+ General Rule, apply scale and rotate transforms

### 11 Introduction To Parenting
+ What is parenting?
+ How to set a parent
+ Parent and child relationships
+ Inheritance

### 12 Empties
+ What is an empty?
+ Why use an empty?
+ Empties are a null object, however have many uses
+ No volume or surface means they don't appear in rendering
+ What they look like is just for visuals
+ They can be used as an organisational parent
+ Placeholders
+ Used for rigging controls and other properties

### 13 What Is A Rig?
+ A character model on its own can't be animated
+ A series of controls external to the model need to be created
+ THIS is Rigging!
+ Any static 3d model needs to be bent, twisted, expanded moved translated etc.
+ We already have the fundamentals of a rig
+ Rigging is a whole new discipline for many and many mistakes and reties will have to be done to get to an end result you want.

### 14 Armatures - A Bone Based Rig
+ Create an armature
+ Identify parts of a bone
+ Bona based is essential for game engines otherwise the animation won't come across.

### 15 Introduction To Constraints
+ Parenting is a form of constraint
+ You can lock transforms
+ Doesn't stop parents transforms
+ Learn about constraining movement

### 16 The Track To Constraint
+ Flesh out the rig controlling the eye bones
+ Use the track to constraint

### 17 Advanced Layout Controls
+ Collapsing windows
+ Create new area windows
+ Swapping areas
+ Getting back default layout
+ Saving the Start-up File
+ Screens - Blender's Workspaces

### 18 Transferring Data Between Blender Files
+ Learn how to transfer settings from one blend file to another
+ Difference between linking and appending
+ https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/dev/data_system/data_blocks.html

### 19 The Dope Sheet - When Keyframes Happen
+ Overview of the dope sheet and what it is used for
+ Different views of the Dope Sheet
+ Expanding to view individual keyframes
+ Using the dope sheet for more precise control over when things happen

### 20 The Graph Editor - How Keyframes Happen
+ Overview of the graph editor
+ Control points and handles
+ Changing handle types

### 21 Creating Multiple Animations
+ On one timeline and Tag
+ Multiple actions
+ Offsetting the animation to ensure no pausing when looping.

### 22 Making Actions Visible Outside Blender
+ We will have to do a little re rigging
+ Learn how to make a bone look like another options
+ Make a rig that will work externally in multiple engines

### 23 Exporting From Blender For Unity
+ Various options for exporting
+ Sometimes experimentation is required
+ Reading through the various options
+ Ensure you only export what you need
+ FBX is generally accepted by all game engines and other 3D Packages
+ FBX contains the mesh objects
+ FBX can export material name and assignment
+ FBX can export armature bone data and mesh weighting

### 24 Exporting From Blender For Unreal
+ Naming issues prevent Unreal from opening our file


### EOSC 3 Short Eye Animations
+ End Of Section Challenge
+ 3 Short Eye Animations
+ Exported As FBX
### Section 2 Wrap Up


***Future Lectures / In another section? / Don't make Sense Here
