## Section 2 - Basic Rigging - Lecture List
Here are the lectures of the course for this section...

### 1 Introduction to Section 2
+ Michael gives an overview, showing you what is coming up in the section ahead.
+ Start with some foundational controls
+ Setup our workspace to suit our task
+ Create a simple rig

### 2 The Outliner Getting Your Naming Right
+ You will understand the importance of naming throughout your project
+ A core skill to get right early on

### 2a Deletion Options
+ How to use the various deletion options
+ Creation but destruction

### 3 Basic Selection
+ Border Selection (B)
+ Circle Selection (C)

### 4 Speeding Up Your Selecting
+ Limit selection to visible
+ Wireframe viewport shading
+ Selecting more/less

### 5 What Is Topology
+ Not all things are created equal
+ Sometimes it doesn't matter
+ Sometimes it is critical to modelling
+ (Updated 22/10/2017)

### 6 Advanced Selection Methods
+ Edge loops
+ Face loops
+ (Updated 19/10/2017)

### 7 Proportional Editing
+ Really Useful when modelling
+ Confusing if left on or influence too large
+ (Updated 20/10/2017)

### 8 Materials And Shading
+ Flat and smooth shading
+ Different shading objects in object and edit mode
+ What is a material
+ Materials are render engine specific
+ Often they will have to be re setup
+ Simple material creation
+ Material slots and reusing materials
+ (Updated 22/10/2017)

### 9 Origins, 3d Cursor And Pivot Points
+ The location of the origin point is important when translating, rotating or scaling an object
+ Take control of how object transform
+ Understand the properties of an object are the object origin's properties
+ The origin affects physics calculations

### 10 Transforms and Applying Them
+ Quick Tip
+ Edit in Edit Mode
+ General Rule, apply scale and rotate transforms

### 11 Introduction To Parenting
+ What is parenting?
+ How to set a parent
+ Parent and child relationships
+ Inheritance

### 12 Empties
+ What is an empty?
+ Why use an empty?
+ Empties are a null object, however have many uses
+ No volume or surface means they don't appear in rendering
+ What they look like is just for visuals
+ They can be used as an organisational parent
+ Placeholders
+ Used for rigging controls and other properties

### 13 What Is A Rig?
+ A character model on its own can't be animated
+ A series of controls external to the model need to be created
+ THIS is Rigging!
+ Any static 3d model needs to be bent, twisted, expanded moved translated etc.
+ We already have the fundamentals of a rig
+ Rigging is a whole new discipline for many and many mistakes and reties will have to be done to get to an end result you want.

### 14 Armatures - A Bone Based Rig
+ Create an armature
+ Identify parts of a bone
+ Constraints - Tracking
+ Bona based is essential for game engines otherwise the animation won't come across.
